          <h2 class="title">About meditation in Venezuela üáªüá™</h2>
          <p>
            We were traditionally a Catholic country. This time (1983) when I
            was born and grew up, the internet did not exist in Venezuela well
            at least it was no accessible and undoubtedly access to oriental
            literature in a physical way was a bit difficult, especially for
            low-income people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crisis, corruption, drug trafficking was the "daily bread" in
            Venezuelan society, even in the pre-Ch√°vez era. It would be
            unimaginable that in such a Western and Christian country, Eastern
            ideological currents could arise, as well as Gnostic religions with
            a profound Buddhist influence, it was curious how the Venezuelan
            idiosyncrasy culturalized the Buddhist statues "brought by Chinese
            immigrants" into objects of adornment and good luck.I never imagined
            at that time, the philosophy hidden behind the fat smiling
            figures,but...
          </p>
          <p>
            In the late 80s and early 90s Japanese oriental animated content was
            broadcast on television, this anime caused an incredible boom in the
            youth of that time, many of these dramas contained oriental
            philosophies that were undermining the adolescent subconscious mind,
            we have the case of "Saint Seya" where we can see the intrinsic
            Buddhist philosophy in many characters. as well as, we can consider
            that the birth of television programs based on yoga or mindfulness
            content obviously influenced by American television channels
            catapulted the popularization of oriental philosophies
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, we could not be sure that Buddhism entered on
            television, but surely the deterioration of the reputation of the
            Catholic Church allowed the popularization of new philosophical and
            religious currents in Venezuela, such as Buddhism.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">How Of Meditation A Day Changed My Life</h2>

          <p>
            In my personal case when I meditated for the first time, I never
            read about meditation or had any concept of Buddhism at that
            moment,in my mind I really felt identified with American culture
            "grunge, basketball, video games, clothes and things like that" I
            was a common teenager 16-year-old with a very heavy emotional
            burden, my parents had divorced due to domestic abuse, our economic
            situation was worse it was really hard to buy food, my mother worked
            as a street vendor but she didn't earn much money, she was a
            Colombian immigrant in Venezuela, and I had dropped out of high
            school.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was definitely a very difficult time, I really felt that I was
            drowning in anxiety, loneliness, lack of courage, frustration,
            resentment, fear, lack of support, multiple headaches, until one
            night I was very tired of everything, I just closed my eyes, I felt
            my heart and began a battle against my mind, where my mind
            reproached me for everything like an enemy, but I just ignored it, I
            remember praying to God with great force "Even though I was an
            atheist" and trying of identifying myself with the light that
            sprouted in my, when suddenly my mind became silent, my being
            expanded as if it were in another dimension and all my frustrations
            disappeared, the light wrapped me up and I understood that my
            internal voice was not necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            other indescribable things happened which would be impossible to
            tell here. It really changed my way of seeing the world, after that
            experience I began to be interested in metaphysics, occultism and
            things like gnostic religions "really waste of time" eventually I
            was consumed by the world, as it was supposed to be, until a few
            years ago I returned to meditate again, which I highly recommend for
            people who, like me, do not identify with any type of religious
            belief, but feel our integration with the universe is necessary.
